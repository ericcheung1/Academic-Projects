# Job Training Analysis using Instrumental Variable regression

This analysis uses data from a federal job training program that took place in the USA in the 1980s.
Training was provided as part of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). The JTPA included a provision
that required the US government to undertake a randomized evaluation of the training program. At the
time, it was the largest randomized training evaluation ever undertaken. One of the objectives of the
evaluation was to determine if federally funded job training increased the income of individuals that
received the training.

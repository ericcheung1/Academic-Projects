# Personal-and-Academic-Projects

I am a fourth year Economcis student at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby BC, Canada. This repository contains a collection of my statistical learning, econometric, data visualization, and Python programming projects. I am currently looking for co-op/internship opportunties as a Data Analyst or Business Analyst.
